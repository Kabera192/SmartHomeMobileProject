# Smart Home Monitoring App

## Project Description
The Smart Home Monitoring App is a Flutter application designed to monitor environmental conditions within a home. It utilizes various sensors commonly found in mobile devices to provide real-time data and automation features. The app includes the following features:

1. **Light Level Sensing and Automation**: Utilizes the device's ambient light sensor to measure brightness levels and implement automation features such as adjusting smart lights or sending notifications based on changes in ambient light levels.

2. **Motion Detection and Security**: Integrates the device's accelerometer sensor to detect motion or vibrations and triggers notifications or alerts when unexpected movements are detected.

3. **Location Tracking and Geofencing**: Implements location tracking to monitor the movement of the device within specified geographical boundaries (geofencing). Uses GPS data to trigger actions or notifications when the device enters or exits predefined areas (e.g., home, work).
